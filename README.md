## Use Cases

### 1. Movie Rankings

Create your personal movie ranking by comparing films head-to-head. Simply add your movie list and start comparing. The Elo algorithm will help you discover which movies you truly prefer over others.

### 2. Product Decision Making

When deciding between multiple product options, use Elo Item Ranker to clarify your preferences through systematic comparisons rather than trying to rank everything at once.

### 3. Team Prioritization Sessions

For team decision making, use the app to prioritize features, tasks, or projects by having team members vote through simple pairwise comparisons.

From ranking your favorite books to prioritizing life goals, the application helps bring structure to subjective preferences.
